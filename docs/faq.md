## General Questions

### What is Pytrix?

Pytrix is a modern, privacy-focused platform for mastering Python through AI-generated practice problems. It combines:

- **Infinite unique questions** generated by Google Gemini
- **Local Python execution** via Pyodide (WebAssembly)
- **Adaptive difficulty** that adjusts to your skill level
- **Privacy-first design** where all data stays in your browser

### How is Pytrix different from LeetCode or HackerRank?

| Feature   | Pytrix                 | LeetCode        | HackerRank      |
| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Questions | AI-generated, infinite | Static, curated | Static, curated |
| Execution | Browser (local)        | Server          | Server          |
| Account   | Not required           | Required        | Required        |
| Cost      | Free + your API key    | Freemium        | Freemium        |
| Privacy   | Client-only            | Server-stored   | Server-stored   |
| AI Hints  | Built-in               | Limited         | Limited         |

### Is Pytrix free?

Yes! Pytrix is open source and free to use. However, AI features require your own Gemini API key, which has its own free tier from Google.

### Do I need to create an account?

No. Pytrix has no accounts, logins, or user registration. All your data is stored locally in your browser.

## API Key Questions

### Why do I need my own API key?

Pytrix uses a **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model for several reasons:

1. **Privacy**: Your key stays in your browser, never on our servers
2. **Control**: You manage your own usage and costs
3. **Security**: No proxy means no middle-man risk
4. **Transparency**: You see exactly what API calls are made

### How do I get a Gemini API key?

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key and paste it in Pytrix Settings

### Is the Gemini API free?

Google offers a generous free tier:

- 15 requests per minute
- 1 million tokens per month
- No credit card required

For most users, this is more than enough for regular practice.

### Is my API key safe?

Yes. Your API key:

- Is stored only in your browser's localStorage
- Is never sent to Pytrix servers
- Is transmitted directly to Google over HTTPS
- Is never logged or stored anywhere

See [Security and Privacy](./security-and-privacy.md) for details.

### What if I don't have an API key?

You can still use Pytrix with limited functionality:

- Template-based questions (no AI enhancement)
- Local Python execution
- Stats tracking

AI features (hints, evaluation, solution optimization) require a key.

## Practice Questions

### How does Auto Mode work?

Auto Mode provides adaptive, rapid-fire practice:

1. **Start**: Begin with a mini-curriculum (String Manipulation)
2. **Solve**: Answer questions at your current difficulty
3. **Adapt**:
   - 3 correct in a row → Increase difficulty
   - Incorrect → Decrease difficulty + remediation questions
4. **Progress**: After the mini-curriculum, focus shifts to your weakest topics

### What's the difference between Auto Mode and Manual Practice?

| Feature            | Auto Mode        | Manual Practice |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Question selection | Automatic        | You choose      |
| Difficulty         | Adaptive         | Fixed           |
| Topic progression  | Curriculum-based | Any topic       |
| Streak tracking    | Per-run          | Per-session     |
| Best for           | Rapid practice   | Focused study   |

### How does difficulty progression work?

In Auto Mode:

- **Streak of 3**: Promote (beginner → intermediate → advanced)
- **Incorrect answer**: Demote + inject 2 remediation questions
- **24 hours inactive**: Streak decays by 50%

In Manual Practice:

- You choose the difficulty directly
- No automatic adjustment

### What topics are available?

Pytrix covers 9 modules with 40+ subtopics:

1. **String Manipulation** — Patterns, palindromes, two-pointers
2. **Arrays & Lists** — Searching, sorting, sliding window
3. **Hash Maps / Dictionaries** — Frequency counting, grouping
4. **Sets** — Operations, uniqueness problems
5. **Stacks** — Matching, monotonic stacks
6. **Queues & Deques** — BFS, sliding window
7. **Linked Lists** — Traversal, cycle detection
8. **Trees** — Traversal, BST operations
9. **Recursion & Backtracking** — Permutations, combinations

See the Modules page (`/modules`) for the complete curriculum.

### Can I practice specific topics?

Yes! Use Manual Practice:

1. Go to `/practice/manual` or press `Cmd/Ctrl+K` and type "manual"
2. Select your module, subtopic, and difficulty
3. Click "Generate Question"

## Technical Questions

### Why does Pyodide take time to load?

Pyodide downloads a ~15MB WebAssembly Python runtime on first use. This is cached by your browser, so subsequent loads are faster.

Typical load times:

- First load: 3-10 seconds (depending on connection)
- Cached: <1 second

### Can I use Python packages like NumPy?

Currently, Pytrix uses a minimal Pyodide configuration. Standard library packages work, but external packages like NumPy are not loaded by default.

If you need NumPy for practice, this is a feature we could add. Open an issue!

### What Python version does Pytrix use?

Pytrix uses Python 3.11.x via Pyodide 0.29.0. You can see the exact version in the Runtime Status Bar at the bottom of the Practice Workspace.

### Why is SharedArrayBuffer required?

SharedArrayBuffer enables true interruption of Python code. Without it:

- Infinite loops would freeze the browser
- You couldn't abort running code
- Timeouts would be less reliable

These capabilities require security headers that Pytrix sets automatically.

### Does my code run on a server?

No. Your code runs entirely in your browser using Pyodide (Python compiled to WebAssembly). It never leaves your machine for execution.

The only server communication is with Google's Gemini API for AI features.

## Troubleshooting

### "API key is invalid"

1. **Check the key**: Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and verify your key is active
2. **Copy again**: Make sure you copied the complete key (no trailing spaces)
3. **Test connection**: Use the "Test Connection" button in Settings

### "Rate limit reached"

Google's free tier has limits:

- 15 requests per minute
- 1 million tokens per month

Solutions:

- Wait a minute and try again
- Reduce API usage by using hints less frequently
- Consider upgrading your Google Cloud tier

### "SharedArrayBuffer is not defined"

This occurs when security headers are missing. In development, restart the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If using a custom deployment, ensure these headers are set:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

### "Session limit reached"

Pytrix has client-side safety caps to prevent accidental overuse. To reset:

1. Refresh the page (resets session counters)
2. Or adjust limits in Settings → Advanced

### Tests keep failing

1. **Check Node version**: Ensure Node.js 20+
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
2. **Clear cache**:
   ```bash
   npx vitest --clearCache
   ```
3. **Reinstall dependencies**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

### The app is slow

1. **Clear browser cache**: Outdated cached files can cause issues
2. **Check network**: Pyodide and AI calls require internet
3. **Reduce prefetch**: In Settings, lower the prefetch count
4. **Check extensions**: Some browser extensions can interfere

## Data and Privacy

### Where is my data stored?

All data is stored in your browser's localStorage:

- Practice statistics
- Auto Mode runs
- Settings
- API key (encrypted: no, but never transmitted to Pytrix servers)

### Does Pytrix track me?

No. Pytrix has:

- No analytics
- No telemetry
- No user accounts
- No cookies (only localStorage)

### Is my code sent anywhere?

Your code is only sent to Google's Gemini API when you:

- Click "Submit" (for AI evaluation)
- Request hints
- Request solution optimization

For local execution ("Run" button), code never leaves your browser.

### How do I delete all my data?

1. **In-app**: Settings → Danger Zone → Clear All Data
2. **Browser**: Clear site data for `localhost` or your Pytrix domain
3. **Selective**: Clear individual stores in Settings

## Feature Questions

### Can I export my progress?

Currently, progress is stored in localStorage. You can:

1. Open browser DevTools
2. Go to Application → Local Storage
3. Export the JSON manually

A proper export feature is planned.

### Can I use Pytrix offline?

Partially:

- ✅ Python execution works offline (after first load)
- ✅ Template-based questions work offline
- ❌ AI features require internet (Gemini API)

### Is there a mobile app?

Not currently. Pytrix is a web application optimized for desktop browsers. The code editor experience is best with a keyboard.

### Can I use my own LLM?

Not yet, but the architecture supports multiple providers. The codebase is designed with provider abstraction in mind. Contributions welcome!
